# Implementation-of-16-bit-RISC-Processor
- In this project I have implemented a 16 bit RISC Processor using a hardware discription language(HDL) called Verilog. The processor is capable of fetching and executing a set of 16-bit machine instructions.
- A 16-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) processor is a type of central processing unit (CPU) that uses a simplified instruction set, allowing for faster and more efficient execution of instructions. The term "16-bit" refers to the width of the data bus and the size of the registers, which are the storage locations for data within the CPU. A RISC processor typically has a smaller number of instructions compared to a traditional Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) processor, which has a more extensive instruction set. RISC processors typically rely on pipelining and other optimization techniques to execute instructions quickly, while also minimizing power consumption and heat generation.
- A 16-bit RISC processor can be used in a variety of applications, including embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and other small-scale computing applications. Some examples of 16-bit RISC processors include the Atmel AVR, Microchip PIC24, and TI MSP430 families of processors.
